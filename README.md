# Cryptocurrency-assignment-Byzantine
In this project, you will implement the basic, unauthenticated Byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm described by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in their seminal paper titled The Byzantine Generalâ€™s Problem [1]. 
The project code provides you with a simple consensus protocol testing framework that you will use to test the correctness of your implementation. 
Read and thoroughly understand all the project code before beginning. 
The Java class named hw4.BasicTests gives several tests that demonstrate how to use the consensus testing framework. 
Your submission should make all the tests pass. 
For example, test0 test case is reproduced below and configures a small network running the FollowLeader consensus protocol described in class that fails to solve the BFT consensus problem for any number of malicious nodes.
